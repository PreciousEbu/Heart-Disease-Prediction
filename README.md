# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project involves the use of R programming to build machine learning models that can predict the occurrence of heart disease with the help of certain habits, features and factors such as BMI, cholesterol level, type of foods consumed, smoking habit etc.  The dataset used was fairly large and provides enough data. However, the dataset was highly imbalanced and favored one class (no heart disease).
